Status Indicators
==================

Dingo has four configurable LEDs on the corners of the chassis, as well as a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) panel on the
rear of the robot.  These lights are used to indicate the robot's status.

Corner LEDs
------------

The corner LEDs use the following patterns to indicate the robot's status:

===============  ===============  ====================
Front LEDs       Rear LEDs        Description
===============  ===============  ====================
Solid white      Solid red        Normal operation
Pulsing orange   Pulsing orange   Battery is low
Flashing orange  Flashing orange  Fault
Flashing red     Flashing red     E-stop is engaged
Solid red        Solid red        ROS is not running
===============  ===============  ====================

While the robot is in the normal operation state the LED colors can be customized by publishing to the ``/cmd_lights``
topic.  In any other state LED customization is disabled.
